# FoldND-UnfoldND-ConvND
The PyTorch framework is currently, in 2024, the dominant Python package in the field of Deep Learning development. Despite this, the package only offers modules for performing convolutions in 2D and 3D feature spaces. This repository contains an implementation of the convolution that extends the operation's functionality to arbitrary dimensions.
